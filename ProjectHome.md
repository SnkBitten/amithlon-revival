# What is it? #

The Amithlon Revival Project aims to continue the work of Bernd Mayer & Harald Frank on [Amithlon](http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/emulators/amithlon.html), while ensuring that no license terms (Open Source, or proprietary) are broken.

Support should be extended to other projects such as [AmiKit](http://amikit.amiga.sk/) and [Anubis](http://www.anubis-os.org/).

Ultimately, the project is supporting AmigaOS (through emulation) and her clones to run as native as possible on x86 hardware.

## Goals & Ideas ##

  * Adapt GPL'd Amithlon kernel code for modern 2.4 and/or 2.6 Linux kernels.
  * Look into adaption of {Free,Net,Open}BSD kernels with (E-)UAE?
  * Develop a method to acquire user's original ROM images & AmigaOS data.
  * Include AmiKit installation procedures in above method on live install media.
